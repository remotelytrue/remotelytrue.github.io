Here's something a little different that I did for my sister and my brother-in-law for their shared birthday. It's in the vein of a Duck Konundrum (see a list of them [here](https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/keyword/duckkonundrum)), So, it's not a puzzle *per se*, but rather a series of detailed instructions that give an answer at the end. 

It was fun to write, albeit a little rushed, as I only had the idea about 2 weeks before their birthday. So, a few things could have been bit more refined and/or tested. But overall I'm pleased with the results.

Anyway, to play, grab three friends, print out the wugs, then cut them out on the lines. Each person should get a relevant page of instructions. Read carefully, write things down, and enjoy!

A few notes: 

* My sister is a linguist, hence the [wugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Berko_Gleason#Children.27s_learning_of_English_morphology.E2.80.94.E2.80.8B.E2.80.8Bthe_Wug_Test) 
* My brother-in-law is a city planner, which is relevant to the answer
* It's probably not too hard to do on your own, but, you know, less fun
