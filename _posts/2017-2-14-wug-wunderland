Here's something a little different that I did for my sister and my brother-in-law for their shared birthday. It's in the vein of a Duck Konundrum (see a list of them [here](https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/keyword/duckkonundrum)), So, it's not a puzzle *per se*, but rather a series of detailed instructions that give an answer at the end. 
It was fun to write, albeit a little rushed, as I only had the idea about 2 weeks before their birthday. So, a few things could have been bit more refined and/or tested.
Anyway, to play, simply grab three friends, print out the wugs, and cut out on the lines. Then, follow the instructions sheets!

A few notes: * My sister is a linguist, hence the [wugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Berko_Gleason#Children.27s_learning_of_English_morphology.E2.80.94.E2.80.8B.E2.80.8Bthe_Wug_Test) * My brother-in-law is a city planner, which is relevant to the answer
